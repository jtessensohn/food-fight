                                Consider this: it's nearing lunch time and someone proposes that the office get lunch together. A well-meaning proposal, but deep down everyone knows what's about to happen. <br />
                                What would be an innocent and civil discussion about where to grub-down, sides are taken instead, hurtful remarks from all sides, and worst of all, lunch is somehow almost over. <br />
                                Skip the bickering, skip the HR complaints, and let's get this Food Fight started.
