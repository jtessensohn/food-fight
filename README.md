<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Food Fight Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

How often have you been with your peers, family, or friends and the conversation of where you are going to eat gets brought up?
I would say at least once, and I would bet that at least half of the time no one can decide on where to eat. Food fight takes the stress out of deciding where to to eat. Each person can have their input and have a chance of their choice of food getting chosen. This way, even though everyone may not be happy about it, it is at least fair.

Here's why:
* We wanted to create a solution that solves the problem any group of people have when spending time together
* People shouldn't be fighting over where everyone should be eating, let the food fight for you

Of course, this solution will not solve all of your interpersonal problems, but this is one less problem you have to worry about between you and your friends. 

### Built With

This section will list the major frameworks that we used to build our project.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [Bootstrap-React](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
